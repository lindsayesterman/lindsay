			<p>Florida has a ratio of 485 students to 1 guidance counselor. I noticed students at my school were
				struggling to find valid information regarding college admissions tips. They had a hard time sourcing
				the tips and then making sure they were reliable. I developed a site called Daily College Tip that
				provides students looking for college counseling with daily, free, emailed college admissions tips.
				Users subscribe on <a class="projects-links" href="http://www.dailycollegetip.com/"
					target="_blank">dailycollegetip.com</a> and they then get tips sent straight to their inbox. Stack:
				Sendgrid, MailChimp.</p><br><br>

			<p>Check out the github repo <a class="projects-links"
					href="https://github.com/lindsayesterman/college-tips" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br></p>

			<p>The project currently has 245 subscribers and has been receiving over 50% open rates. In Fall of 2020, I
				am going to be launching a more complex version to distribute to high school students.</p><br>
