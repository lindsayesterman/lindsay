	<p>Florida has a ratio of 485 students to 1 guidance counselor. I noticed students at my school were struggling to find valid information regarding college admissions tips. They had a hard time sourcing the tips and then making sure they were reliable. I developed a site called Daily College Tip that provides students looking for college counseling with daily, free, emailed college admissions tips. Users subscribe on <a class="dct-links" href="http://www.dailycollegetip.com/" target="_blank">dailycollegetip.com</a> and they then get tips sent straight to their inbox. Stack: Sendgrid, MailChimp<br> <br>Check out the github repo <a class="dct-links" href="https://github.com/lindsayesterman/college-tips" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>The project has 35 subscribers and has currently been receiving over 70% open rates. In Fall of 2020, I am going to be launching a more complex version to distribute to high school students.</p><br>
