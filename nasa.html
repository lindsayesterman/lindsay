            <p>Nasa Apod Postcards provides a thoughtful and meaninful, yet quick thinking-of-you message/present. It is an app that allows users to input a special date and design a card for the recipient. You can type in the day of your anniversary, birthday, or any memorable day, and a gorgeous picture of the stars will appear. Then you can personalize the picture with an appreciative message. <br><br>

                I created this app for a few reasons. One being that 43% of people still send most of their mail digitally. I wanted to come up with an innovative and fun way to encourage people to partake in more digital messaging. It is a better use of time, money, and is less harmful towards the environment. The other reason I built this website is to encourage people to appreciate one another and still send thoughtful messages. Relationships are hard and a little thoughtfulness and appreciation goes a long way. <br><br>
