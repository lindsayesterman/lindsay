            <p>CS students often have a hard time finding partners. They want to do meaningful work with someone who has
                the same interests as them and complements their abilities, but it can be difficult to meet someone with
                these qualities organically. Team’n Up solves this problem. Team’n Up allows you to search for CS
                partners based on interests, skills, languages, location, etc. We help you filter through tons of coders
                to find the perfect teammate for you. </p><br><br>
            <p>Growing up in a suburb, knowing no one in the tech industry, finding like minded STEM students to work
                with has been hard. Having this site allows students like me to find a partner who they can learn from
                and solve important matters with. </p><br><br>
            <p>Team’n Up was a top 5 winner in the Helix Hacks Hackathon. Team'n Up won “Most Creative” out of 72 other
                projects. </p><br><br>
